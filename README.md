# Unifi Hotspot Portal
Captive Portal for Guest Wifi with Unifi


As shown in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn10R0KTyRE&t=1609s) about smart home automations on the german Youtube channel "Spiel und Zeug", I have build a captive portal for my guest wifi network using my Unifi network gear.n

The state of my private implementation was/is not ready for publication as source code due to various reasons, including some bugs.
Still under the linked original video there was quite some interest raised to get a guide or runnable solution for it by quite a few people.
The idea was to start this repository which might evolve in an actual open source solution with more features and better reliability.

For the beginning I am starting an initial [Issue](https://github.com/thomas-br/unifi-hotspot-portal/issues/1) for discussion where I will also provide some basic information about the current solution.
From time to time I hope to find time to turn it into an open-source solution with the limiting factor of time and lots of other stuff on my list.
At the same time I hope to find also contributors helping with the project.
